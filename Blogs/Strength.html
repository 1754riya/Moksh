            hildren attend international schools while others go to regular schools. Some parents celebrate
            birthdays
            in a grand manner, while others don't.
            These
            contrasting experiences have a significant impact on both the child and the parent. Comparisons among
            children arise, such as academic performance,
            which
            affects the child's mindset as all these factors accumulate in their mind. Nowadays, every child is
            focused
            on their career and aspiring to go
            abroad. They
            often leave their homes to live in hostels, where they are exposed to shocking differences. They
            struggle to
            comprehend seeing other children with
            iPhones,
            laptops, and extravagant spending habits, appearing intelligent, confident, and multi-talented. This
            hypocrisy is difficult for them to digest,
            including the
            prevalence of romantic relationships. The pressure to fit in leads some into depression, negativity, and
            jealousy. They may resort to negative
            habits like
            smoking and gambling, further spiraling into a state of depression.

          <p class="mb-4">
            In such situations, it becomes challenging for youngsters to stand up for the truth. While they are
            aware of
            the wrongness of smoking or drinking,
            they lack the
            strength to resist peer pressure. Here, Dadaji comes into their lives as a brave role model who guides
            them
            towards the path of truth. In college,
            they
            encounter numerous temptations, face ridicule if they don't participate, and feel lonely if they choose
            to
            stand apart. It's essential to consider
            the long-term
            consequences of succumbing to negative influences, as it not only affects the individual but also their
            entire family. The aim of life should be
            peace of mind,
            not just money. It's crucial to seek peace in positive and protective environments, surround oneself
            with
            courageous people, and never feel alone.
            Sometimes,
            going against the majority is the right path to take for one's career and personal growth.

            <b><i>"God is with you."</i></b> When you believe that He is there with you, watching over you, how can
            you
            do something wrong? How can you follow
            the wrong
            path? The feeling
            of support is there with you, supporting you. Your Guru will be there, and your own family will send
            support
            for you. Small temptations that come
            your way...
            Swami Vivekananda has said, 'Stand up, be brave, be bold. You are the creator of your own destiny, so
            you
            have to create your own destination. Your
            entire life
            is in your hands. As you sow, so shall you reap. If you get into bad company, you are ruining your whole
            life. If you stay in the company of good
            people, you
            will make your life successful. Don't hesitate to open up and speak up about any doubts or questions in
            your
            mind. If you don't communicate, you
            will keep
            overthinking, and you won't know whether you are right or wrong in your decisions. Open up and speak up
            to
            your friends or family. You can manage to
            speak to
            them, or we will show you the right path. You will not be betrayed. You may feel tempted when you see
            your
            friends having boyfriends or girlfriends
            while you
            don't, and someone tells you that you are outdated. You feel low about it, out of place, uncomfortable
            going
            for outings or parties. But don't you
            realize that
            the majority consists of fools? You are on the right path, so why assume that you are wrong? You are, in
            fact, right. Stand by what is right, be
            bold, and don't
            be scared. We are scared of rejection, but if our friends reject us, they were not meant to join us in
            our
            party. We will be left alone, but don't
            worry. God is
            with you, and your family is here. You can enjoy them. Dadaji, wants all youngsters as of all, the
            soldier,
            has to always be brave.we cannot be
            depressed, we
            cannot be unhappy. You have to be strong, brave, ever ready, shining, sparkling like the sun. Dadaji
            tells
            us that we are sons of Lord Suraj Devta,
            so we should
            always be shining and happy. The sun always shines, sparks always cover up the darkness. So we, as sons
            of
            God, sons of Surya Devta, should also
            spread light in
            the universe. All the darkness inside us will vanish if we carry the Guru's teachings with us. It is
            possible."
