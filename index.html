          There are numerous mental problems affecting the people in modern society, including fear, false egos, anxiety, comparisons, competitions, peer pressure and stressful work environment. Mental health issues can lead to physical discomforts such as headaches, stomach aches, difficulty sleeping, irritability, and inability to focus. If left unaddressed, chronic stress can exacerbate these symptoms and give rise to more severe health concerns, including anxiety, hypertension, and reduced immunity. Furthermore, chronic stress is associated with long-term health problems like depression, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
          Our body consciousness is leading us to all these problems. People are running for happiness, but when one desire is not met they are completely broken and want to escape. We become soul conscious when we read Bhagavad Gita, which gives us the strength to fight all life's challenges like Arjun.
